# odin-recipes
This is my Odin Recipes Project.
In this project, I will be utilizing what I have learned in HTML to create a webpage that displays recipes. I will also be using git to push the project to the github repository as well as comitting changes every so often. 
I will be utilizing HTML tags such as <p> and <a> as well as including images in my pages. I will use absolute and relative paths to link to other webpages from the Internet and from my own files. 

This is my Odin Recipes Project - Completed!
