This is my Odin Recipes Project.
In this project, I will be utilizing what I have learned in HTML to create a webpage that displays recipes. I will also be using git to push the project to the github repository as well as comitting changes every so often. 
I will be utilizing HTML tags such as <p> and <a> as well as including images in my pages. I will use absolute and relative paths to link to other webpages from the Internet and from my own files.

This is my Odin Recipes Project - Completed!
In this project, I definitely utilized a lot of what I had learned in HTML. Lists were utilized in the steps and ingredients for each recipe. I used relative paths for the images and the links for each recipe. I decided to download the images to my local machine and use relative paths for those to avoid a possible change of link or removal of image that would cause a broken image link in my project. Lastly, I utilized a lot of git to stage my changes and then commit them to my local repository. Now I just need to push the final changes to my Github repository. Overall, I found the project to be very useful in applying what I've learned so far, and I look forward to coming back to it later to refine it once I gain more skills.
