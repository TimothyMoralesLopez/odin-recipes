        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place heavy cream and grated nutmeg in a large mixing bowl with a fine mesh strainer on top. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine milk and vanilla. Cook over medium heat, swirling occasionally, until bubbles form around the sides and the milk starts steaming.</li>
            <li>In another mixing bowl, vigorously beat together the eggs, yolks, sugar, and salt for approximately 3-5 minutes until the mixture is thickened and pale. Add in the milk in a slow stream and whisk to incorporate. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon for about 6 minutes, or until the mixture reaches 165 F as read on a cooking thermometer. Immediately strain into the mixing bowl with the heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Place in refrigerator uncovered and allow the eggnog to cool completely for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>To serve, pour eggnog into glasses filling only Â¾ of the glass. Top with whipped cream, cinnamon, and freshly grated nutmeg.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your treat!</li>
